# Project 

This workflow calculates *in vivo* bacterial replication rates from single time point metagenomics sequencing with [iRep](https://github.com/christophertbrown/iRep).

## Overview

The human gut is inhabited by a diverse community of microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiota, which is deeply connected to human health [[1]](#1). In disease, the gut ecosystem experiences drastic perturbations to its physical environment, which can impact both the host and the microbial communities that inhabit it [[2,3,4]](#2,#3,#4). A common perturbation to the gut environment is due to malabsorption, which leads to an increase in gut osmolality, or the number of non-absorbed particles in intestinal contents. Malabsorption is caused by laxative use, food intolerances or inflammatory bowel disease [[2,5]](#2,#5). Gut osmolality increases induce osmotic diarrhea by causing water to exit cells to balance the disrupted osmotic potential [[6]](#6). This also affects the gut microbial communities in a species dependent manner [[2,7]](#2,#7).
